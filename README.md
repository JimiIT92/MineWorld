Minecraft is a great game, but there is still something that can be done better; something that is still missing from the game despite all these years.
Do you ever had the same feeling about the game? A feeling that the overall experience can and must be improved?
Well... let me introduce you to **MineWorld!**

-------------------------

### 🤔 What is MineWorld?

MineWorld aims to be a _**Vanilla extension mod**_. This mean that most of the features that you'll find in MineWorld are not so different
from Vanilla features (like new woods, new ores, tools, mobs...).

In MineWorld you'll find tons of new blocks and tools, several new biomes, new dimensions with unique mobs and bosses, and much more!
Plus the mod will be constantly updated to follow latest Minecraft releases, so stay tuned for any future update.

-------------------------

### 📜 Updates

MineWorld mimics Vanilla not only in its features, but in its updates cycle as well. In fact, between major releases, there will always be some snapshots, where you can test
the new features and leave feedbacks about them before the actual release (just like Vanilla Snapshots). Occasionally there could be some minor versions,
which usually contains just bug fixes.

Also, each major version (and occasionally even some minor one) have their own theme, which is usually announced when the previous major version is released.

-------------------------

### 👨🏼‍💻 How to contribute

Anyone can contribute to MineWorld, suggesting their ideas [using the Feature Request module](https://github.com/JimiIT92/MineWorld/issues/new?assignees=JimiIT92&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=)

The best part is that requests are not limited in any form. You can literally suggest an entire update and, if it fits the MineWorld criteria, it could be
realized! In fact, version 0.8 is mostly composed by community ideas and feedbacks, thus the name "The social update".

If your idea makes it to the mod you'll also be mentioned in the mod's credits! 😁
But remember: your suggestion must meet the MineWorld criteria. What are these criteria, you ask? Well, they are kinda the same as the Vanilla game,
but they are not that strict. For example, if you want to add a new ore or a material that is just a _recolor_ of an existing one
and doesn't add any new functionality you can! So, before submitting your request, ask yourself "Could this be a suitable addition to Vanilla Minecraft? 
Is in line with other features the mod has?". If the answers to both questions is "yes", then you'll have a 
high chance that your suggestion will be accepted and implemented into the next MineWorld major update!

-------------------------
### 🖥 Downloads

You can download MineWorld on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-world-mod).

**I will post new releases only there**. When a new version or spapshot is released, a new blog post will be available on
[the official MineWorld blog](http://mineworldminecraft.altervista.org/blog), which will give more details and insights about the update.

Any other websites that offers you MineWorld shouldn't be trusted and should be reported immediately (as they could be a scam and contain malicious software)!

-------------------------
### 🍺 Support the project

Developing and maintaining MineWorld, and its related websites, requires a lot of time and effort, 
but after all I really enjoy doing this ❤

MineWorld is, and **<ins>always</ins>** will be, **<ins>FREE TO USE</ins>**. 

If someone asked you some money to download MineWorld, I am afraid to tell you that you got scammed! 😥

But if you **really** want to financially support the project (or just buy me some beer to produce more code), these are the only ways:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/JimiIT92" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/default-orange.png" width=330 height=75 alt="Buy Me A Beer"></a>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=26VTWV4CY282S" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/PayPal_logo.svg/1280px-PayPal_logo.svg.png" width=330 height=75 alt="Donate with PayPal"></a></p>

Any other websites asking you money for this project is a scam, and you should immediately report it to your local authorities as well! 😡

-------------------------
### 😁 Conclusion

Minecraft is getting bigger and better with every release. With MineWorld we can make it even better!

I hope you enjoy MineWorld as much as I enjoy develop new ideas and content for it, 
and let me know if there are any issues on the issue tracker.

Have a nice day! 😁
