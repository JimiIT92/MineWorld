# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository contains the source code for [MineWorld](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-world-mod).
Only latest major release (and relative minors) will be supported. Any other release prior to these will be automatically considered deprecated as soon as a new release is out.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The only place to report a bug or an issue is the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/JimiIT92/MineWorld/issues) of this repository.

**DO NOT SEND EMAILS**. 
They often go into the spam folder, and so they can get lost, or I can read them even months after you sent it. 
So please, if possible, use the Issue Tracker if you want to report a bug, suggest a new feature or in general make a question (is literally there for this reason).
